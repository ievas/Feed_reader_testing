# Project: Feed reader testing

In this project students were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and started writing the first test suite. Rest of the tests had to be completed by the students.

## How to run

Clone or download the repository and open index.html in a browser of your choice.
